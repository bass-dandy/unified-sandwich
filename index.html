			<h1>The Unified Sandwich Framework</h1>
			<div class="underline"></div>
			<p>
				<em>Is a Pop-tart a sandwich?</em> A simple question, but any answer must probe the very essence
				of what it means to be a sandwich. Previous attempts include the
				<a href="https://twitter.com/matttomic/status/859117370455060481" target="_blank">Sandwich Alignment Chart</a>,
				which answers <em>what kind of person calls a pop-tart a sandwich</em>, and the
				<a href="https://cuberule.com/" target="_blank">Cube Rule</a>,
				which answers <em>under what conditions might a Pop-tart be called a sandwich</em>, but their
				conclusions are tempered by their inability to recognize a fundamental truth: everything is a
				sandwich, to some extent. The critical question is not <em>is a Pop-tart a sandwich</em> but
				rather <em>how sandwichy is a Pop-tart</em>, and the Unified Sandwich Framework (USF) provides
				the path to an answer in quantifiable terms. Within the USF, the purity of any sandwich can be
				assesed by assigning scores to its five facets sandwichdom:
				<a href="#structure">structure</a>,
				<a href="#composition">composition</a>,
				<a href="#geometry">geometry</a>,
				<a href="#temporality">temporality</a>, and
				<a href="#intellection">intellection</a>.

				<h2>Structure</h2>
				<h3>The arrangement of elements</h3>
				<div class="underline"></div>
				<p>
					An ideal sandwich consists of some number of ingredients fixed between two samples of a different
					ingredient. A sandwich's <strong>structure</strong> score does not reflect the ingredients
					themselves, only their arrangement as a whole. Take for example an aluminum composite panel
					- two thin aluminum sheets bonded to a non-aluminum core. This is structurally similar to a
					grilled cheese despite the fact that aluminum is inedible. More abstractly, sequences of
					events can have a high structural score when sampled over time. What is a day but a time of
					light between times of dark, a week but a time of labor between times of rest, and a life but
					one's experience between birth and death?

				<h2>Composition</h2>
				<h3>The parts in proportion</h3>
				<div class="underline"></div>
				<p>
					An ideal sandwich is edible. It is usually composed of bread, meat, cheese, lettuce, and
					other such vegetables and condiments, though alternative elements such as peanut butter
					and jelly are common. The <strong>composition</strong> score of a sandwich reflects the
					sandwich's ingredients and the ratios between them. While an aluminum composite panel is
					similar in structure and ingredient ratio to a grilled cheese, it falls short in its
					ingredient set. On the other hand, a chicken salad with croutons has a similar ingredient
					set to a chicken sandwich, but the ratios between them are less ideal. The search for the
					canonical set of ingredients and their golden ratio is ongoing, so scores for this facet
					tend to be more subjective (read: controversial) than others.

				<h2>Geometry</h2>
				<h3>The relative size and shape</h3>
				<div class="underline"></div>
				<p>
					An ideal sandwich can be held in one hand. It is approximately square in shape when viewed from
					above and rectangular when viewed from the side. The corners may or may not be rounded. While
					the ideal shape is axiomatic, the ideal size is relative to one's own hand and is therefore
					variable for each observer. A sandwich's <strong>geometry</strong> score reflects its distance
					from these ideal measurements - the higher the distance, the lower the score. As a broad example,
					a burger, a hotdog, and a sub are all lesser sandwiches than a turkey club. Each scores highly
					in structure and composition but strays from the ideal in size and shape.

				<h2>Temporality</h2>
				<h3>The relative timing</h3>
				<div class="underline"></div>
				<p>
					An ideal sandwich exists in the present. But what of a sandwich just consumed? Though it is
					no longer a sandwich in the traditional sense, it is, in a way, still a sandwich, because
					it <em>once was</em> a sandwich. And what of a sandwich being created? Though it is not
					yet a sandwich, it still has a high probability of becoming one. So it is that a not-yet
					sandwich must score the lowest in <strong>temporality</strong>, as there is no way to know
					for sure that it will ever come to be. The higher the probability of its sandwichdom the
					higher its score (a plate of bread, lettuce, tomato, and bacon is more likely to become an
					ideal sandwich than would be a block of lead). A once-was sandwich scores relatively higher still,
					but ultimately both a sandwich in the future and a sandwich in the past are less of a sandwich
					than a sandwich in the present.

				<h2>Intellection</h2>
				<h3>The concept</h3>
				<div class="underline"></div>
				<p>
					An ideal sandwich exists in thought as well as matter. The very notion of a sandwich was
					born of human minds, thus without <strong>intellection</strong> a sandwich cannot be.
					Indeed every sandwich was once but an idea - the <em>idea</em> of a BLT, the <em>idea</em>
					of a turkey club, the <em>idea</em> of a ham and swiss melt - their translation into matter
					nothing more than a detail of execution. In practice, applying scores to this facet is easier
					than one might think. In naive terms, the thought of a sandwich is more of a sandwich
					than the thought of a bowl of spaghetti.
