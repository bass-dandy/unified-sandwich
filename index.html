				<h2>Structure</h2>
				<h3>The arrangement of elements</h3>
				<div class="underline"></div>
				<p>
					An ideal sandwich has some number of solids and liquids held between two instances of
					a different solid. It is important to note that a sandwich's <strong>structure</strong>
					score has nothing to do with these elements themselves, merely their arrangement and state
					of matter. Take for example an aluminum composite panel, which consists of two thin aluminum
					sheets bonded to a non-aluminum core. Such an object scores similarly to a grilled cheese
					along this axis. More abstractly, sequences of events can have a high structural score
					when sampled over time. What is a day but a time of light between times of dark, a week
					but a time of labor between times of rest, and a life but one's experience between birth
					and death?

				<h2>Composition</h2>
				<h3>The parts in proportion</h3>
				<div class="underline"></div>
				<p>
					An ideal sandwich is, above all else, edible. It is composed mostly of bread, meat, cheese, lettuce,
					and some number of other vegetables and condiments, though alternative elements such as peanut butter
					and jelly are common. The <strong>composition</strong> score of a sandwich is based both on its
					component parts and the ratio between them. The search for the canonical set of ingredients
					and their golden ratio is ongoing, so scores along this axis tend to be more subjective than
					others (at least at the high end of the spectrum). Nonetheless it should be clear that inedibles
					always score lower than edibles regardless of their structure.

				<h2>Geometry</h2>
				<h3>The relative size and shape</h3>
				<div class="underline"></div>
				<p>
					An ideal sandwich can be held in one hand. It is approximately a rectangular cuboid in shape, with
					the opposing faces along the vertical axis possessing a convex hull that is nearly square
					and the distance between those faces being somewhat less than the length of their edges. Though
					the ideal shape is basically axiomatic, the ideal size is relative to the hand of the subject
					and therefore varies. A sandwich's <strong>geometry</strong> score is impacted by a its distance
					from these ideal measurements - the greater the difference, the lesser the score.

				<h2>Temporality</h2>
				<h3>The relative timing</h3>
				<div class="underline"></div>
				<p>
					An ideal sandwich exists concurrently with the subject. But what of the sandwich they just consumed?
					Though it is no longer a sandwich in the traditional sense, it is, in a way, still a sandwich,
					because it <em>once was</em> a sandwich. And what of the sandwich they are about to create?
					Though it is not yet a sandwich, it still has a high probability of becoming one. So it is that
					a not-yet sandwich must score the lowest in <strong>temporality</strong>, as there is no way to
					know for certain that it will ever come to be. The higher the probability of its sandwichhood the
					higher its score (a plate of bread, lettuce, tomato, and bacon is more likely to become a sandwich
					than would be a block of lead). A once-was sandwich scores relatively higher still, but ultimately
					both a sandwich in the future and a sandwich in the past are less of a sandwich than a sandwich
					in the present.

				<h2>Intellection</h2>
				<h3>The concept</h3>
				<div class="underline"></div>
				<p>
					An ideal sandwich exists in thought as well as matter. The very notion of a sandwich was born
					of human minds, thus without <strong>intellection</strong> a sandwich has no meaning. Indeed
					every sandwich was once but an idea - the <em>idea</em> of a BLT, the <em>idea</em>
					of a turkey club, the <em>idea</em> of a ham and swiss melt - their translation into matter
					nothing more than a detail of execution. It is not an exaggeration to say that without
					<strong>intellection</strong> there would be no way to score a sandwich at all, as there would
					no Platonic ideal against which a sandwich could be judged. While there are a multitude of ways
					to judge intellection in practice, in its most naive terms the idea of a sandwich is more of a
					sandwich than the idea of a bowl of spaghetti.
